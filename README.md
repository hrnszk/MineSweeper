# MineSweeper

This is a shopping list implemented with Kotlin in Android Studio.

Implemented features:
- 5X5 game area
- 3 mines
- check box to determine the mode (Flag: place a flag, Try: “Try” a field)
- During “Try a field” mode: if you hit a mine, the game ends, if you did not hit a mine, a number appears on that field indicating how many mines
are nearby.
- During “Flag” mode: if you flagged a field but there is no mine, the game ends, if you flagged a field and there are no more mines, the game end and the player
wins!
- displays messages to users with Toasts.
